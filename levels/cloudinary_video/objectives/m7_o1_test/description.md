Thanks for your help! We can't wait to deploy our website to show all the Cloudinary videos! We made a **video player** that can play our videos anywhere on any webpage, but we need some help setting it up. Can you help us?

> <b>TIP:</b> Experiment with URLs without leaving the game, using the <button onclick='window.CloudinaryBrowser.showUrlExplorer();'>Cloudinary Explorer</button>

## Preparation
Learn more about our Cloudinary video player [here](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/cloudinary_video_player?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021). It's simple to add to our website! Why don't you give it a shot?

1. Open the **code editor** by clicking on the _\</> Show Code Editor_ button on the right.
2. You'll notice a web application's source code in the code box. Fill in the code block that says `// ----- Put your JS code below ----- //` . Use the example in the link above to help you!
3. Run the server by pressing the _â–¶_ button.
4. If the code looks correct, then click _HACK_ to proceed.

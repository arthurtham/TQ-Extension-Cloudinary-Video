# Changing Video Quality

</ul>

You can control the video quality with the quality parameter (q in URLs). You can specify a quality value between 1 (lowest) and 100 (highest). Reducing the quality is a trade-off between visual quality and decreased file size.

The automatic mode typically provides an ideal balance between quality and file size.

1. Enter the high quality url using the q_100 parameter
2. Enter the low quality url using the q_10 parameter
3. Enter the auto quality url using the q_auto parameter 
4. Click _HACK_ to proceed.

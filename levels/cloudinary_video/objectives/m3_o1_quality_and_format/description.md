You are becoming a pro when it comes to working with URL parameters! Soon you will be ready to dig into the API! You just need to get familiar with a few more things before we get to that point. Let's learn about changing the quality of your video!

********************

You can control the video quality with the quality parameter (**q_** in URLs). You can specify a quality value between 1 (lowest) and 100 (highest). Reducing the quality is a trade-off between visual quality and decreased file size.

The automatic mode typically provides an ideal balance between quality and file size.
## <a name="questions">Questions</a>
1. Enter the high quality url using the **q_100** parameter
2. Enter the auto quality url using the **q_auto** parameter
3. Enter the low quality url using the **q_10** parameter
 
4. Click _HACK_ to proceed.

When working with Cloudinary by hand, one of the first things you'll usually need to do is upload the source image or video assets.

There are three ways to upload assets:
1. **API** - If you want to implement your own upload functionality, Cloudinary provides a secure and comprehensive Image and Video upload API [learn more...](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_images#uploading_with_a_direct_call_to_the_rest_api?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021).
2. **Upload Widget** - Just a couple lines of code to integrate, eliminates the need to develop in-house interactive media upload capabilities. [learn more...](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_widget?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021)
3. **Media Library** - This is the simplest way when you're working with the media by hand. The [Media Library](https://cloudinary.com/console/media_library?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021) is accessed via the tab in the [Cloudinary Console](https://cloudinary.com/console?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021).

## Steps
Let's upload our first asset using #3, the **Media Library** option. 

We're going to use a small, free for commercial use, no attribution required video. (foreshadowing: we'll still be adding attribution in a future mission)

1. Download [this video](https://pixabay.com/videos/succulent-lemon-pig-face-flower-14467/)
    1. Click **Free Download**
    2. Choose **640x360!!!**
    3. Click **Download**
    4. Save the file temporarily on your computer
2. Go to [Media Library](https://cloudinary.com/console/media_library?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021) in the [Cloudinary Console](https://cloudinary.com/console?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021) 
Direct link: https://cloudinary.com/console/media_library
2. Upload the **Succulent - 14467.mp4** file by either dragging the file into the browser window OR clicking the **Upload button** and then selecting **Upload Local Files**

Now that the file is uploaded, click the 3 dots on top right corner of the asset and click on "Copy URL" and go back to TwilioQuest to paste it into the Resource URL and click _HACK_ to proceed.

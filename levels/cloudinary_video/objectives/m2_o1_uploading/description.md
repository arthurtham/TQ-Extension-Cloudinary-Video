When working with Cloudinary by hand, one of the first things you'll usually need to do is upload the source image or video assets.

There are three ways to upload assets:
1. **API** - If you want to implement your own upload functionality, Cloudinary provides a secure and comprehensive Image and Video upload API [learn more...](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_images#uploading_with_a_direct_call_to_the_rest_api).
2. **Upload Widget** - Just a couple lines of code to integrate, eliminates the need to develop in-house interactive media upload capabilities. [learn more...](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_widget)
3. **Media Library** - This is the simplest way when you're working with the media by hand. The [Media Library](https://cloudinary.com/console/media_library) is accessed via the tab in the [Cloudinary Console](https://cloudinary.com/console/).

## Steps

1. Download [this video](https://pixabay.com/videos/succulent-lemon-pig-face-flower-14467/)

    1. Save the file temporarily on your computer

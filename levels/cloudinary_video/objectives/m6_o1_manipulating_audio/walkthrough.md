## Objective-specific Resources
- [Adjust the Audio Volume](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/audio_transformations?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021#adjust_the_audio_volume) 

## Detailed Instructions
You'll need to use a new parameter that we haven't learned yet to adjust the volume of the video. I think [this link](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/audio_transformations?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021#adjust_the_audio_volume) is what we need. Luckily, it's that simple- we add that parameter and we should be good to go!

Note that there are different inputs you can add as the parameter's value, but I would focus on the percentages.

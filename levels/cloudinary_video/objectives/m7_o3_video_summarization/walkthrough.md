## Detailed Instructions
Refer to the documentation above to learn how to use the preview parameter.

You'll need to use the `duration`, `max_seg`, and `min_seg_dur` properties with the `preview` parameter to get this to work!

You should also make sure that you have access to the demo folder by utilizing the auto upload mapping feature described in the objective's tab.

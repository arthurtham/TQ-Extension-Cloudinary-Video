# Help Guide

## Specific to this objective

You can use the [Media Library](https://cloudinary.com/console/media_library?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021) to organize the assets you upload. 

Let's organize the file we uploaded by putting it into a new folder called **TwilioQuest**

1. Go to the [Media Library](https://cloudinary.com/console/media_library?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021)
2. [Create a folder](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/dam_folders_collections_sharing#create_folders?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021) and name it **TwilioQuest** then Click _Save_.
1. Select the video asset and click on ["Move to folder"](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/dam_folders_collections_sharing#move_assets_between_folders?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021) that shows above, pick the TwilioQuest folder and click _Move_.
2. The video will disappear from your Home folder (the folder that shows when you first go to the Media Library)
3. Open the **TwilioQuest** folder. The URL for the asset has changed to include the folder name before the file name.

Now let's change the name of our asset to something easier to remember and type!

1. Click on the blue "Succulent - 14467.mp4" name and the Manage screen will open, or simply double click the image to manage it.
2. [Change the video asset](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/dam_manage_individual_assets?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021) name from **Succulent_-_14467.mp4** to **Flower**.
Keep in mind that when you first load it, it may take a few seconds for the filename to be editable.
3. Copy the new URL and paste it into the hack interface to proceed.

Your answer should look like this but will be using your cloudname rather than "joelsimpson" and the version in the URL is generated on your end if you made any changes to your asset.

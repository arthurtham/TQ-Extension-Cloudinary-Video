You can use the [Media Library](https://cloudinary.com/console/media_library) to organize the assets you upload. 

Let's organize the file we uploaded by putting it into a new folder called **TwilioQuest**

1. Go to the [Media Library](https://cloudinary.com/console/media_library)
2. Create a folder by clicking the PICTURE NEEDED icon and type in **TwilioQuest** for the name, then Click _Save_.
3. Now click the circle icon on the image you uploaded to select it and an action menu will appear. PICTURE NEEDED
4. Select the "Move to folder" PICTURE NEEDED icon, pick the TwilioQuest folder and click _Move_.
5. The video will disappear from your Home folder (the folder that shows when you first go to the Media Library)
6. Double-click the **TwilioQuest** folder to open it.
7. The URL for the asset has changed to include the folder name before the file name.

Now let's change the name of our asset to something easier to remember and type!

1. Click on the blue "Succulent - 14467.mp4" name and the Manage screen will open.
2. Click the name again at the very top of the screen, and you will be able to edit the name. Let's call it **Flower**.  
3. It will take a moment to complete the rename process.
4. Copy the url by clicking the link icon PICTURE NEEDED.
5. Paste it into the hack interface to proceed.

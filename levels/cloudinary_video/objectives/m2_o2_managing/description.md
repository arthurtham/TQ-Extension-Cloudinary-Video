Great job on successfully uploading your first video! We have another task that you need to learn how to rename your video and then move your video to another location. Good luck!

********************

You can use the [Media Library](https://cloudinary.com/console/media_library?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021) to organize the assets you upload. 

Let's organize the file we uploaded by putting it into a new folder called **TwilioQuest**

1. Go to the [Media Library](https://cloudinary.com/console/media_library?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021)
2. Create a folder by clicking the ![Create Folder](https://res.cloudinary.com/tessamero/image/upload/v1629232150/TwilioQuest/upload_folder.png) icon and type in **TwilioQuest** for the name, then Click _Save_.
3. Now click the grey circle icon ![Image Selection](https://res.cloudinary.com/tessamero/image/upload/v1629242955/TwilioQuest/select_image.png) on the top left of the image you uploaded to select it and an action menu will appear. ![Image Menu](https://res.cloudinary.com/tessamero/image/upload/v1629243103/TwilioQuest/asset_actions.png)
4. Select the "Move to folder" ![Move to Folder](https://res.cloudinary.com/tessamero/image/upload/v1629243178/TwilioQuest/move_to_folder.png) icon, pick the TwilioQuest folder and click _Move_.
5. The video will disappear from your Home folder (the folder that shows when you first go to the Media Library)
6. Double-click the **TwilioQuest** folder to open it.
7. The URL for the asset has changed to include the folder name before the file name.

Now let's change the name of our asset to something easier to remember and type!

1. Click on the blue "Succulent - 14467.mp4" name and the Manage screen will open, or simply double click the image to manage it.
2. Click the name again at the very top left of the screen, and you will be able to edit the name. Let's call it **Flower** as seen below 
![Renamed Video to Flower](https://res.cloudinary.com/tessamero/image/upload/v1629243413/TwilioQuest/video_rename_flower.png)
Keep in mind that when you first load it, it may take a few seconds for the filename to be editable.
1. Copy the url by clicking the link icon ![Copy URL again](https://res.cloudinary.com/tessamero/image/upload/v1629244010/TwilioQuest/copy_url_diff.png)
2. Paste it into the hack interface to proceed.

Your answer should look like this but will be using your cloudname rather than "joelsimpson" and the version in the URL is generated on your end if you made any changes to your asset.

https://res.cloudinary.com/joelsimpson/video/upload/v1627081950/TwilioQuest/Flower.mp4

click _HACK_ to proceed.

  <li>Fetch the fighting kitten video from your media library.</li>
  <li>Overlay the music from the dog view onto the fighting kitten video.</li>

Nice work with the dog video! Now, we want to take that video and apply it to a kitten video as well. This should be as easy as applying an overlay to the kitten video. Can you help us with that?

## Preparation
1. Use the same method that you got the `dog.mp4` video to get the fighting kittens video:

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/<cloud_name>/video/upload/<version>/demo/kitten_fighting.mp4
```

2. Now, apply the `/demo/dog.mp3` audio file as a video layer on top of the fighting kitten video.

3. Click _HACK_ to proceed.

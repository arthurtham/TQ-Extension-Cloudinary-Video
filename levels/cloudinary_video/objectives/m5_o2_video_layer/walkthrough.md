* [Video Transformations](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/video_manipulation_and_delivery?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021)


### Detailed Instructions
Just like the _l_text_ layers that we added in the last objective, we can add images using the root layer _l\_video:_ property and appending the public name of an image from our account. 

For complete information, see [Adding Image Overlays](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/video_manipulation_and_delivery?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021#adding_image_overlays) and pay careful attention to the Important note. Since we are using an image from our TwilioQuest folder, we'll need to use the ":" notation like `.../l_twilioquest:flower,.../`.

The start/end time, positioning, and radius are parameters you learned in previous mission. Do you remember them?

You answer should look something like this, with all parameters replacing the placeholders below:
~~~text
.../video/upload/c_scale,w_###/l_<public-asset-id>,w_###,........../samples/sea-turtle.mp4
~~~

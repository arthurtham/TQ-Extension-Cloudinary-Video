******************

Before we can really get started, you'll need to know where to find all of the resources and documentation. Also, if you want to get in contact with us with additional questions, meet others who are also working on these missions, or find other developers who work with media, you can join the Discord community.

We are all about community and helping other developers succeed. Thank you for joining us and enjoy!

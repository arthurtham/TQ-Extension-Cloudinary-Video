<h3>To-Do List</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Sign Up</b> for a free Cloudinary Account.</li>
  <li><b>Configure</b> your environment.</li>
</ul>
</div>

There are few things to do before we can really get started.

## Sign Up

<!-- @todo-p1 explain free account, credits, etc FLAVOR IT?-->

Go to [cloudinary.com/signup](https://cloudinary.com/signup) to register for a free account. This free account gives you 25 credits per month that will be far more than enough for this adventure and any other experimenting that you would like to do.

## Configure
Once you've signed up, go the Cloudinary [Dashboard](https://cloudinary.com/console) to get your:
* Cloud Name
* API Key
* API Secret

You'll need these Credentials to complete this objective and configure your access to Cloudinary.
<!-- @todo-p1 environment configuration settings -->
